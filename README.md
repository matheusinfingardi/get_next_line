# ðŸŒ€ get_next_line

## **General Description**

*The get_next_line project from the 42 School aims to implement a function in C that reads a single line from a file each time it is called, efficiently handling file I/O operations. The function should be capable of handling varying buffer sizes and managing memory properly. This project helps in understanding file manipulation and efficient memory management in C.*

## **Project Objective**

Implement the function get_next_line with the following prototype: </br>
``` c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```
### **Parameter:**

**fd:** The file descriptor from which to read the line.

### **Return Value:**

The line read from the file, including the terminating newline character \n (unless it's the end of the file without a newline).
NULL if there is nothing more to read or if an error occurred.

### **Expected Behavior:**

The function should allow reading a file line by line with successive calls.
It should work both for regular files and for the standard input (stdin).

## **Common Instructions**

To meet the requirements of the 42 School, the project must adhere to specific rules and restrictions:

### **Norm Compliance:**
_The code must conform to the 42 Norm, which includes coding style, function usage, and code organization.
All bonus files must also follow the Norm._

  **Stability and Safety:**
      The function should not fail unexpectedly (e.g., segmentation faults, bus errors, double frees).
      All dynamically allocated memory must be properly freed, with no memory leaks.

  **Compilation:**
      Must use cc and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
      The project must compile with various BUFFER_SIZE values defined using -D BUFFER_SIZE=n.

  **Allowed Functions:**
      The only allowed external functions are read, malloc, and free.

  **No Globals or libft:**
      Global variables are not allowed.
      Can not use libft in this project.

## **Mandatory Part:**
The get_next_line function and organize it into the following files:

 - **get_next_line.c:** The main implementation of the get_next_line function. </br>
 - **get_next_line_utils.c:** Auxiliary functions that support the main implementation. </br>
 - **get_next_line.h:** Declarations and prototypes required for the get_next_line function. </br>
